# 3806ICT_Ass3
## Overview of tasks
1. Make CSP solver (BFS)
   * Complete (?)
2. Make RL solver
   * Already in the lab
3. Make maze generator
   * Requires bug fixing
4. Translate the grid world to PAT model and a model for RL
   * To start
5. Experiment with PAT vs RL for Maze Runner and write about results
   * To start
   * Basic idea: plot enough to find a rough big-o notation of both. Its expected that we get O(n) 
   where n = cells and no idea what to expect for RL.
